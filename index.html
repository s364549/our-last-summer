        Dorian Gray threw his hat and coat upon the table and passed into 
        the library. For a quarter of an hour he walked up and down the room, 
        biting his lip and thinking. Then he took down the Blue Book from one 
        of the shelves and began to turn over the leaves.

        "Alan Campbell, 152, Hertford Street, Mayfair." Yes; that was the man 
        he wanted. At nine o'clock the next morning his servant came in with a 
        cup of chocolate on a tray and opened the shutters.

        The man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke, 
        and as he opened his eyes a faint smile passed across his lips, 
        as though he had been lost in some delightful dream.

        Dorian was sleeping 
        quite peacefully, lying on his right side, with one hand underneath 
        his cheek. He looked like a boy who had been tired out with play, or 
        study.

        Yet he had 
        not dreamed at all. His night had been untroubled by any images 
        of pleasure or of pain. But youth smiles without any reason. 
        It is one of its chiefest charms.

        He turned round, and leaning upon his elbow, began to sip his chocolate. 
        The mellow November sun came streaming into the room. 
        The sky was bright, and there was a genial warmth in the air.
