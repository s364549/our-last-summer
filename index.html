			<h2>Mountain Hike!</h2>
			<p>
        First we all took a trip to the northern parts of Norway and hiked.
        it was summer, but the snow could still be seen atop the mountains.

			<h2>Driving with Andreas</h2>
			<p>
        On our trip through Norway we met a guy named Andreas. This person was a proffesional 
        driver, or so he said. He tought us how to speed on the highway without getting caught 
        and also how to evade the police if they were on our tail.
      </p>

    <div>
      <p class="description" id="desc2">
        Since then we got a mail from Andreas a few weeks back where he said that he was put in prison!
        We were all suprised and are still wondering how such a thing could've happened.

			<h2>Italy</h2>

        In the middle of the summer we went to Italy together, we flew the day after gamenight,
        in the afternoon.

      <p class="description" id="desc4">
        Arriving in Italy was great fun, we ate pizza, saw Italian cinema and bathed. The pizza
        did indeed have that thin crust everyone talks about, and the tomato sauce was astonishing.

			<h2>Pigs in Italy</h2>

        Pigs in Italy are suprisingly well taught!

      <p class="description" id="desc5">
        We went to a circus were they had pigs who could talk, sort of, they made noises
        whenever they were given food. Maybe that is just what pigs do.
