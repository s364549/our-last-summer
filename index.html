			<h2>Walk</h2>
			<p>
        Finally we got to meet up. At last Alex finished her two weeks in quarantine
        after arriving from France, and in real social distancing fashion, we 
        walked together slowly on the outskirts of Oslo. Andreas is on his last year
        of uni. Alex still does her creative art stuff.

			<h2>Drive</h2>
			<p>
        After our road trip to Bygdøy Alex sent this meme in the group chat. He didn't quite
        pop a sideways wheelie, but Andreas was pretty darn close.
        How does his Volvo not even have a dent in it yet? Only damage
        it's ever experienced is a tiny scrape on the finish towards the back  
        because of Andreas' terrible parallel parking attempt.

			<h2>Game night</h2>
			<p>
        We decided not to go to the beach afterall on Saturday because it started to rain, 
        even though we’d been talking about going all summer. 
        Couldn’t be happier, honestly. Night marathon of Mario Kart was 
        probably the most fun we had all summer. I was surprised at how determined Alex 
        was to win. She only played as Donkey Kong.

        Yes, those are pink and purple LEDs in the back. We set them up to match the colors on

			<h2>Airport</h2>
			<p>
        When they relaxed the travel restrictions, Alex could finally go back home and 
        see her family in Gordes. She promised to keep in touch and she 
        totally wants to visit Oslo again and hang out with us. Must be weird for her, 
        growing up in a quaint village, seeing the capital of Norway, even if it's tiny compared
        to Paris or London.

        I've never seen Gardermoen this empty. Even if the airport had to check
        everyone's test results, Alex waited in probably the shortest airport line 
        I'd ever seen. Our goodbye-moment became short.

			<h2>Piglet</h2>
			<p>
        I got a snap from Andreas at his farm the other day.  
        This runt is one of Andreas’ favorite piglets. 
        Just six-seven hours old in this picture. 
        They’re all doing pretty well. At Bygdøy 
        he said I should come visit his farm and his piglets sometime. 
        He lives on the other side of the country and I embarrassingly 
        don’t have my driver’s license yet, but he said he’d come pick me up, and drive me all the way there,
        and finally we'll sing along to ABBA.

			<h2>Beach</h2>
			<p>
        You're not here anymore, so I had to go to the beach by myself. I messaged Alex, 
        but no reply. Hope she's doing okay. Every now and then I think about us. I ask myself 
        the same question. Maybe we spent too much time doing the same things over and 
        over? Wish I'd spent 
        more time getting to know you when I had the chance, and that we had more 
        serious conversations. Truth is probably just that you're busy living your lives 
        like I'm living mine. I'm so grateful we got to hang out, and 
        I hope you know that you can still reach out to me whenever.
