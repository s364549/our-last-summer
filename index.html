			<h2>Selfie</h2>
			<p>
        We finally got to meet up. Alex had to stay two weeks in quarantine
        after arriving from France. In real social distancing fashion, we 
        walked together slowly on the outskirts of Oslo. Walking on the fresh,
        soft forest grass, we caught up on our lives. Andreas is on his last year
        of uni and Alex is still doing her creative art stuff.

			<h2>Game night</h2>
			<p>
        We decided not to go to the beach that one Saturday since it started to rain, 
        even though we’d all been talking about going all summer. 
        I couldn’t be more glad, honestly. Staying up all night playing Mario Kart was 
        probably the most fun we had all summer. I was surprised at how determined Alex 
        was to win. She only played as Donkey Kong.

        When they relaxed the travel restrictions, Alex could finally go back home and 
        see her family in Gordes. She promised to keep in touch and that she 
        totally wants to visit Oslo again and hang out with us. (...)

			<h2>Piglet</h2>
			<p>
        I got a snap from Andreas at his farm the other day. 
        Mama pig had fourteen beautiful babies. 
        This runt is one of Andreas’ favorite piglets. 
        He’s just six-seven hours old in this picture. 
        They’re all doing pretty well. When we stayed in Bygdøy 
        he said I should come visit his farm and meet his sheep sometime. 
        He lives on the other side of the country though and I (embarrassingly) 
        don’t have my driver’s license yet, but he said he’d pick me up and we’d 
        sing along to ABBA on the whole ten hour long drive.

			<h2>Beach</h2>
			<p>
        You're not here anymore, so I had to go alone. I messaged Alex, 
        but I'm not getting any replies. I hope something serious didn't happen, 
        and that she's doing okay. Every now and then I think about us, and ask myself 
        the same questions. Maybe we spent too much time doing the same things over and 
        over, and maybe you weren't really enjoying yourself that much? I wish I'd spent 
        more time getting to know you when I had the chance, and that we had more of the 
        serious conversations. The truth is probably just that you're busy living your lives 
        just like I'm living mine, but I find it difficult trying to remain rational, 
        not knowing where you are. At least I'm grateful we got to hang out at all, and 
        I hope you know that you can still reach out to me whenever.
