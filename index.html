			<h2>Walk</h2>
			<p>
        We got to meet up finally. Alex had two weeks in quarantine
        after arriving from France. In real social distancing fashion, we 
        walked together slowly on the outskirts of Oslo. Stepping on the fresh,
        soft forest grass, we caught up. Andreas is on his last year
        of uni. Alex still does her creative art stuff.

			<h2>Drive</h2>
			<p>
        Meme from Alex in the group chat after our road trip to Bygdøy. He didn't quite
        pop a sideways wheelie, but Andreas was pretty darn near.
        How does his Volvo not even have a dent in it yet? Only damage
        it's ever experienced is a tiny scrape on the finish towards the back. 
        Andreas' terrible parallel parking attempt.

			<h2>Game night</h2>
			<p>
        We decided not to go to the beach that one Saturday since it started to rain, 
        even though we’d been talking about going all summer. 
        Couldn’t be more glad, honestly. Night marathon Mario Kart. 
        Probably the most fun we had all summer. I was surprised at how determined Alex 
        was to win. She only played as Donkey Kong.

        Yes, those are pink and purple LEDs in the back. We set them up to match the colors on 
        the screen while playing, and it enhanced the experience by a thousand times.

			<h2>Airport</h2>
			<p>
        When they relaxed the travel restrictions, Alex could finally go back home and 
        see her family in Gordes. She promised to keep in touch and that she 
        totally wants to visit Oslo again and hang out with us. Must be weird for her, 
        growing up in a quaint village, then seeing the capital of Norway, even if it's tiny compared
        to Paris or London.

        I've never seen Gardermoen this empty. Even if the airport people have to check
        all the passengers' test results, Alex waited in probably the shortest airport line 
        I'd seen. Our goodbye-moment became too short.

			<h2>Piglet</h2>
			<p>
        I got a snap from Andreas at his farm the other day. 
        Mama pig had fourteen beautiful babies. 
        This runt is one of Andreas’ favorite piglets. 
        Just six-seven hours old in this picture. 
        They’re all doing pretty well. In Bygdøy 
        he said I should come visit his farm and his sheep sometime. 
        He lives on the other side of the country and I embarrassingly 
        don’t have my driver’s license yet, but he said he’d pick me up.
        We'll sing along to ABBA for the whole ten hour long drive.

			<h2>Beach</h2>
			<p>
        You're not here anymore, so I had to go alone. I messaged Alex, 
        but no reply. Hope something serious didn't happen, 
        and she's doing okay. Every now and then I think about us. I ask myself 
        the same questions. Maybe we spent too much time doing the same things over and 
        over, maybe you weren't really enjoying yourself that much? Wish I'd spent 
        more time getting to know you when I had the chance, and that we had more of the 
        serious conversations. Truth is probably just that you're busy living your lives 
        just like I'm busy living mine, but I find it difficult trying to remain rational, 
        not knowing what's going on. Grateful we got to hang out at all. 
        Hope you know that you can still reach out to me whenever.
