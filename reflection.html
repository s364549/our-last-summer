    We began by discussing the overarching concept that we wanted for our website. 
    To create an experience as immersive as possible, we agreed to
    allocate one visible window height to each of the images, so that the user 
    could view the photos and their accompanying description, one at a time. For 
    the mobile version, due to the smaller screen size, we concluded that it would be more appropriate to dedicate
    one screen height to the picture itself and its caption, then a following one for 
    the accompanying text. We then created two wireframes, one for each version. 
    In the two wireframes, one screen height is indicated by alternating colored rectangles.
    For accessibility, we added same page links to our wireframes.

    Starting out we layed out our planned html elements in the right order.
    We assinged each section to the class screen, indicating one viewport height.
    Using the pseudo-selector :first-child, we positioned the text container within each viewport
    and changed its presentation. We assigned the captions to a .description class,
    and positioned them likewise. At first we used the background-image CSS rule to add the pictures, 
    but then considered it more sensible and responsive to add the photos as picture and img html elements.
    
    The reasoning for using both picture, img and srcset nested within is to provide a fallback 
    solution in case the offered source element fails to load or is unusable (Mozilla, 2021). 
    The picture element tells the browser which image to use, we think is useful if the
    user frequently resizes their window, since picture will immediately change the image source 
    based on a media query. We believe the img element is more useful when the user's viewport remains 
    the same throughout the browsing, which is the more realistic scenario. 
    That is why we have placed the img element first within each picture element. Img 
    We want to provide the option for the browser to pick the best source, which 
    can save on bandwidth and loading times. Therefore we consider img to be the more 
    responsive option of the two.

    The most difficult part of implementing the two wireframes was scaling, both of the images and 
    of the texts. When using flexbox, the images would stretch in every direction to 
    adjust to its container. We could have solved this issue with the align-self attribute, 
    but decided to not use flexbox and thus task ourselves with positioning each website element 
    manually, giving ourselves more control. Using position: absolute, width, top and margin, we 
    were able to place all of the elements exactly where we wanted. Since there is a virtually 
    endless selection of mobile phones and consequently phone screen resolutions, we decided to 
    let the pictures scale with the size of its viewport for the mobile version. 

    Another challenge we encountered was
